This module provides functionality for creating and manipulating a doubly linked list (DLL) in C programming language.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $\ast$
\item The DLL is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element contains a key-\/value pair and maintains references to both the next and previous elements in the sequence.
\item 
\item \#\# Features
\item -\/ {\bfseries{Insertion\+:}} Insert a new element into the DLL with a specified key and data.
\item -\/ {\bfseries{Removal\+:}} Remove an element from the DLL by its key.
\item -\/ {\bfseries{Search\+:}} Find an element in the DLL by its key.
\item -\/ {\bfseries{Initialization\+:}} Initialize an empty DLL.
\item -\/ {\bfseries{Printing\+:}} Print the contents of the DLL.
\item 
\item \#\# File Structure
\item -\/ {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{MyDLL_8h}{My\+DLL.\+h}}\+:}} Header file containing declarations of structures and functions.
\item -\/ {\bfseries{My\+DLL.\+c\+:}} Source file containing implementations of functions declared in \mbox{\hyperlink{MyDLL_8h}{My\+DLL.\+h}}.
\item -\/ {\bfseries{main.\+c\+:}} Main program file demonstrating usage of the DLL module through test scenarios.
\item 
\item \#\# Usage
\item To use this DLL module in your C program, include the header file {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{MyDLL_8h}{My\+DLL.\+h}}} in your source code. You can then call the provided functions to perform operations on the doubly linked list.
\item 
\item \#\# Test Scenarios
\item The module includes test scenarios in the {\ttfamily main.\+c} file to demonstrate the functionality of the DLL module. These scenarios cover insertion, removal, and search operations on the DLL.
