/**
 * @mainpage Doubly Linked List Module
 *
 * @brief This module provides functionality for creating and manipulating a doubly linked list (DLL) in C programming language.
 * 
 * @details The DLL is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element contains a key-value pair and maintains references to both the next and previous elements in the sequence.
 * 
 * ## Features
 * - **Insertion:** Insert a new element into the DLL with a specified key and data.
 * - **Removal:** Remove an element from the DLL by its key.
 * - **Search:** Find an element in the DLL by its key.
 * - **Initialization:** Initialize an empty DLL.
 * - **Printing:** Print the contents of the DLL.
 * 
 * ## File Structure
 * - **MyDLL.h:** Header file containing declarations of structures and functions.
 * - **MyDLL.c:** Source file containing implementations of functions declared in MyDLL.h.
 * - **main.c:** Main program file demonstrating usage of the DLL module through test scenarios.
 * 
 * ## Usage
 * To use this DLL module in your C program, include the header file `MyDLL.h` in your source code. You can then call the provided functions to perform operations on the doubly linked list.
 * 
 * ## Test Scenarios
 * The module includes test scenarios in the `main.c` file to demonstrate the functionality of the DLL module. These scenarios cover insertion, removal, and search operations on the DLL.
