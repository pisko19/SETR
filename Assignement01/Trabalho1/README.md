/**
 @mainpage Doubly Linked List Module
 
 @brief This module provides functionality for creating and manipulating a doubly linked list (DLL) in the C programming language.
 
 @details The DLL is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element contains a key-value pair
 and maintains references to both the next and previous elements in the sequence.
 
 <b>Features:</b>
 - <b>Insertion:</b> Insert a new element into the DLL with a specified key and data.
 - <b>Removal:</b> Remove an element from the DLL by its key.
 - <b>Search:</b> Find an element in the DLL by its key.
 - <b>Initialization:</b> Initialize an empty DLL.
 - <b>Printing:</b> Print the contents of the DLL.
 - <b>Sorting:</b> Sort the DLL in ascending or descending order based on keys.
 - <b>Clearing:</b> Remove all nodes from the DLL.
 
 <b>File Structure:</b>
 - <b>MyDLL.h:</b> Header file containing declarations of structures and functions.
 - <b>MyDLL.c:</b> Source file containing implementations of functions declared in MyDLL.h.
 - <b>main.c:</b> Main program file demonstrating usage of the DLL module through test scenarios.
 - <b>Testes.h:</b> Header file containing declarations of functions for testing the MyDLL functionality.
 - <b>Testes.c:</b> Source file containing implementations of functions declared in Testes.h for testing the MyDLL functionality.
 
 <b>Usage:</b>
 To use this DLL module in your C program, include the header file MyDLL.h in your source code. You can then
 call the provided functions to perform operations on the doubly linked list. Make sure to link MyDLL.c with your
 main program file during compilation.
 
 <b>Test Scenarios:</b>
 The module includes test scenarios in the main.c file to demonstrate the functionality of the DLL module.
 These scenarios cover insertion, removal, search, sorting, and clearing operations on the DLL. Additionally, the
 Testes.h and Testes.c files provide test functions for verifying the behavior of the MyDLL library. These functions
 perform various operations such as insertion, removal, searching, sorting, and clearing on a doubly linked list-based
 database implemented using the MyDLL library. Each test function is designed to validate specific aspects of the DLL's
 functionality, ensuring robustness and correctness.
