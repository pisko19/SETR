This module emulates a simple vending machine using the n\+RF52840 development kit with functionality for coin insertion, product selection, and credit return. The Vending Machine Emulator project simulates the behavior of a vending machine, allowing users to insert coins, browse products, purchase products, and return remaining credit. The system uses four push-\/buttons for user input and four LEDs for output indications. Debug and status messages are communicated via UART to a PC terminal.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Push-\/\+Button Functionality\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Button 1\+: Insert 1 EUR coin
\item Button 2\+: Insert 2 EUR coin
\item Button 3\+: Browse products/options
\item Button 4\+: Enter to validate a choice
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{LED Functionality\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item LED 1 and 2\+: Indicate the active product/option
\item LED 3\+: Dispense product
\item LED 4\+: Display available credit
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Operation Description\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Users insert coins, which accumulate as credit.
\item Users can browse through three products and one option to return credit using the browse button.
\item Products/options cycle in a loop (e.\+g., after the last product, the first product becomes active).
\item The Enter button validates selections, dispensing products if enough credit is available or returning credit.
\item Each product has a specific price (Product 1\+: 1 EUR, Product 2\+: 2 EUR, Product 3\+: 3 EUR).
\item Users must press Enter after dispensing a product or returning credit to complete the operation.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Product/\+Option Coding by LEDs\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Off-\/\+Off\+: Return credit
\item Off-\/\+On\+: Product 1 (1 EUR)
\item On-\/\+Off\+: Product 2 (2 EUR)
\item On-\/\+On\+: Product 3 (3 EUR)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Information Display\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Current product and credit are displayed via UART on a PC terminal.
\item Messages indicate successful purchases or credit returns.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{File Structure\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{main_8c}{main.\+c}}\+:}} Main program file demonstrating usage of the vending machine module and interaction with the hardware.
\item {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{Statechart_8h}{Statechart.\+h}}}} Header file for the state machine used in the vending machine emulation.
\item {\bfseries{statechart.\+c\+:}} Source file containing implementations of functions declared in statechart.\+h for the state machine used in the vending machine emulation.
\item {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{Statechart__required_8h}{Statechart\+\_\+required.\+h}}\+:}} Header file containing prototypes for functions required by the state machine implementation.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{Usage\+:}} To use this vending machine emulator in your C program, include the header file statechart.\+h in your source code. You can then call the provided functions to interact with the vending machine via button inputs and LED outputs. Additionally, ensure that statechart\+\_\+required.\+h is included to access the required function prototypes for the state machine implementation.

{\bfseries{Test Scenarios\+:}} The module includes test scenarios in the \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8c}{main.\+c}} file to demonstrate the functionality of the vending machine emulator. Additionally, the Test.\+h and Test.\+c files provide test functions for verifying the behavior of the vending machine. These functions perform various operations such as inserting coins, browsing products, making purchases, and returning credit.
